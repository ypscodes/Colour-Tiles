# Color Tiles
This game is based on colours and patterns. Given a 5x5 grid made with tiles of 6 different colors, the goal is to try and make this 3x3 grid in its center. Out of the 25 tiles, one will be empty which can be swapped with any of the four adjacent tiles.

- Make a 5x5 grid with 6 distinct colors and 24 tiles (one grid has to be empty to allow the tiles to move)
- Generate a random 3x3 grid for each game
- Implement scoring (based on the number of moves taken) and a timer
- Include a reset button to start a new game
